01-11-21:
    ->implemented inputting of string and printing important info in a output.txt using C file handling.
    ->this .txt file will then be used as input in future verilog programs.

05-11-21:
    -> read and learned about using file handling to extract inputs.
    ->implemented storage in 2d matrix using File handling in verilog.
    ->defined length of target_matrix.

06-11-21:
    ->TODO: try making a module for MM.
    -> started implementing multiplication of inverse with encrypted matrix.
    -> implemented password imput using file handling in verilog.

07-11-21:
    -> Made a ReadMe.md file to show module hierarchy, and input-outputs.
    -> Submitted project updates and .zip files.

13-11-21:
    ->Tried to implement signed multiplication, but failed. :`(;
    ->TODO: implement decryption into characters using file handling.(in verilog , if possible)

14-11-21:
    -> implemented matrix multiplication and implemented decryption into characters using file handling.
    -> program is functional, needs to be reviewed and add comments.
 
 15-11-21:
    ->added comments.
    ->tested program. WORKING.
    -> TODO: start report writing.
           : update README.md and add instructions.
